        <em>Farewell My Beloved</em> is a small personal project I created while learning ASP.NET.
    </p>

    <p>
        The idea comes from my love for <strong>Hololive</strong> and the community around it.
        Over time, I&apos;ve seen members graduate and leave, but I&apos;ve also seen how fans come
        together to say goodbye with love, gratitude, and respect.
    </p>

    <p>
        This app is a space where anyone can do the same
        whether it&apos;s for their oshi, a favorite creator, or anyone they want to honor with a farewell.

    <h2>Who's Behind This Project?</h2>
    <p>
        Hi, I'm a Software Engineering graduate with a passion for clean design,
        thoughtful systems, and building useful tools.
    </p>
    <p>
        After a few years working in IT and exploring software development projects,
        I found myself fascinated by how smart processes can shape real outcomes.
        This platform is a side project born from that curiosity, combined with my love for
        minimalism, user-centered design, and a bit of gamification theory I picked up back in university.
    </p>
    <p>
        I believe great technology should be simple, fair, and even a little bit fun.  
        Thanks for being here. I hope you find it meaningful and refreshing!
    </p>
